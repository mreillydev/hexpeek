                                Test Invocation
                                ---------------

Tests are run by invoking './run' in this directory. Results from previous test
runs will be deleted, and new results will be stored in ./results directory.
A logfile will be created in ./results/run.log.

usage: './run [SUITE] [-plugins] [-size min max] [-clean]'

    A specific test suite (e.g. 'base', 'fixedxl') can be specified as SUITE,
    in which case only that suite will run; otherwise, all known tests will run.

    Test suites:
        base        base command testing
        advanced    randomized test patterns with backup/recover testing
          -plugins  as above, but with extra plugin tests, e.g. die & recover
        fixedxl     large file testing (requires 35 GiB in total space)

The optional flags are only meaningful to randtests:

    -plugins runs extra variations that need hexpeek built with
    hexpeek_plugins.c from advanced/ and HEXPEEK_PLUGINS defined.

    -size uses generated files within the given domain.

    -clean unlinks generated files after their test is complete.


                             Environment Variables
                             ---------------------

HEXPEEK_BASEDIR     The path to the root project directory. If unspecified, set
                    automatically by ./run.

HEXPEEK_RUNUNDER    Program under which to run hexpeek (used by most, not all,
                    tests). For example, a trace tool. If unspecified, unused.

HEXPEEK_DIFFBIN     Program to diff two files that returns 0 if same, non-zero
                    otherwise. The return code of this program is checked, but
                    its standard output is always redirected to /dev/null. If
                    unspecified, "simplediff -binary" will be used.

HEXPEEK_DIFFTEXT    Performs the same function as $HEXPEEK_DIFFBIN, but used to
                    compare stdout/stderr results and other text files. If
                    unspecified, "simplediff -text" will be used.

HEXPEEK_SHOWBIN     Program to visually show the differences between two
                    non-text files. If unspecified, unused. hexdiff may be used
                    for this variable, but not set by default.

HEXPEEK_SHOWTEXT    Program to visually show the differences between two text
                    files. If unspecified, unused.

HEXPEEK_TESTPORT    Port to be used for sockettest. If unspecified, 58585.

HEXPEEK_DUMPTOOL    Program to perform an uppercase hexadecimal dump with no
                    extraneous formatting. Only used by dumpcmp. The program
                    must accept the -s and -l options as understood by hexpeek.
                    If unspecified, "hexpeek -hexu -p +lineterm" will be used.
