                 Brief descriptions of data files used in tests
                 ----------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data files listed below are not distributed outright (due to their sizes),
but are reconstructed from a hexpeek autoskip dump and checked against a
standard cksum file the first time they are needed by the test script.

hugetest-cusp.hexpeek-test-data
    Consists of the hexadecimal octet string 11223344 repeated. Total file
    size is 4GiB - 1 octets.

hugetest-cusp.hexpeek-test-data-exp
    Result of running operations in hugetest-cusp.in on
    hugetest-cusp.hexpeek-test-data.

hugetest-6GiB.hexpeek-test-data
    Consists of the hexadecimal octet string 0022446688AACCEE1133557799BBDDFF
